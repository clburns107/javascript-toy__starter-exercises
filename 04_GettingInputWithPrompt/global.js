//1. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their name, then assign that value to a well-named variable.

var name = prompt("What is your name?","My name is");

//2. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their age, then assign that value to a well-named variable.

var age = prompt("What is your age?", "My age is");

//3. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their hometown, then assign that value to a well-named variable.

var hometown = prompt("Where did you grow up?", "I grew up in")

//4. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their favorite number, then assign that value to a well-named variable.

var num = prompt("What is your favorite number?", "My favorite number is")

//5. Output each of those values using both `console.log()` and `alert()`. You can output the value itself with no context around it, but it's a better decision to use each of those values in a sentence. For example: "Your name is Aloysius."

alert("Your name is " + name + ". You are " + age + "years old and grew up in " + hometown + ". Your favorite number is " + num)

console.log("Your name is " + name + ". You are " + age + "years old and grew up in " + hometown + ". Your favorite number is " + num)
