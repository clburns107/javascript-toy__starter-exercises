  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
  <p>1. What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use `typeof` and `console.log()` to help with this.
  </p>

  <p>
  The data entered into the form comes in as a string even if the user types in a number.
  </p>


  <p>2. What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?
  </p>

  <p>
  An empty string is saved
  </p>

  <p>3. How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?
  </p>

  <p>
  i chose my variable names based on the information i was asking for. I believe a person could reasonably prediction what is stored in each variable. 
  </p>

  <p>4. If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Yes changing a question warrants changing a variable name. However re-ordering a question on a page does not.
  </p>

  <p>5. In these exercises, we use `prompt()` to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use `prompt()` -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with `prompt()`? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use `prompt()`?
  </p>

  <p>
  Propmt is not used often in websites because you dont have much control over how the window looks.  
  </p>
  
  <p>6. Research `prompt()` -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?
  </p>

  <p>7. What questions do you have?
  </p>

  <p>
