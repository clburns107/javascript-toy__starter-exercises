 <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>
  <p>
  1.What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?
  </p>

  <p>
  A string cannot be converted to an integer unless its a number.  If letters are submitted <strong> before </strong> a number the result is NaN. For it to be parsed correctly either only provide a number or make sure that the number is the first thing in the string.
  </p>


  <p>2.What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?
  </p>

  <p>
  Same thing happens
  </p>

  <p>3.What questions do you have? 
  </p>

  <p>
  why did you use x++ instead of ++x? it looks as though x++ returns the original value of x?
