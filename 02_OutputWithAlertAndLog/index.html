  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert is a pop-up dialog box that is opened by the browser.  Console.log() displays information in the actual browser</p>
  
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>If the information theyve entered into a form in incorrect</p>
  <p>Maybe you'll have a couple paragraphs for an answer?</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Having to close out the dialog box before continuing would be obnoxious for filling out a form rather than just reloading the form and listing any errors at the top.</p>
